# Conway's Game of Life

You can see more infos about Conway's Game of Life on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

This is just the basic algorithm and nothing fancy ( intitial commit heh )

## TODO

* Display the result in a canvas instead of some shitty ASCII
* Allow the user to choose the size of the world
* Allow the user to choose the spawn probability for cells ( if they want a lot of cells of nah )
* Display the number of iterations
* Display some kill feed ( how many cells live / are dead )
