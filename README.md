## TODO

* Allow the user to choose the size of the world
* Allow the user to choose the spawn probability for cells ( if they want a lot of cells of nah )
* Allow the user to choose the starting pattern by toggling cases or start with a random world
* Display the number of iterations
* Display some kill feed ( how many cells live / are dead )
